// superagent-bluebird-promise bug:
// https://github.com/KyleAMathews/superagent-bluebird-promise/issues/68
// Any error on the backend results in a long warning in the console
// because of missing .stack property on the error
// It is set in the code with Object.defineProperty but apparently that is not good enough for bluebird
